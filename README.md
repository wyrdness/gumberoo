## Overview

The Gumberoo is a huge bear-like creature with hairless rubbery black skin from Pacific Northwest lumberjack folklore. Bullets bounce off its leathery hide, but fire causes it to explode violently.

## Characteristics

- **Size**: Large as black bear or larger
- **Skin**: Hairless, black, leathery, rubbery/bouncy
