      "full": "The Gumberoo is a fearsome critter from Pacific Northwest lumberjack folklore, described as an enormous bear-sized creature with hairless, black, leathery skin that has a rubbery, bouncy quality. According to the tales, the Gumberoo would raid logging camps for food, and its rubbery hide made it invulnerable to conventional weapons - bullets and arrows simply bounced off. However, the creature had one fatal weakness: exposure to fire caused it to explode violently and spectacularly. The Gumberoo represents the fearsome critter tradition of creating creatures with exaggerated invulnerabilities and absurd weaknesses."
